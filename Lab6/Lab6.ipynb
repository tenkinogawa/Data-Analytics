    "In general, Gaussian Process (GP) is a stochastic process used for modeling data, which were observed over time, space or both. Main thing that can characterise GP is that is a kind of generalization of normal probability distributions, where each of them describes a random variable (scalar or vector if we deal with multivariate distribution).\n",

    "GP can be fully determined by only declaring mean and covariance functions. Mean in most cases is set to value \"0\", because such a setting can be useful, simplifies matters and is not a difficult requirement to fulfill. Of course, there are examples\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Its main property is that its value is usually only dependent on the distance from the specified point. The parameter which RBF kernel uses is $l$ as a characteristic length scale. RBF is infinitely differentiable. That means the GP with this kernel has a mean square derivatives for all orders. Other worth noting kernel, in terms of our classess is one from exponentiated quadratic family, where $\\rho$ is length-scale and $\\alpha$ is marginal deviation:\n",

    "Gaussian Process is growing in popularity of usage in domains connected with statistics and machine learning. It is especially efficient solution, while we are dealing with a problem of obtaining data e.g. for faulty cases or just an overall lack of comprehensive data and if we want to obtain not only prediction but also confidence interval. Main areas where GP is used for are: regression, prediction, classification and identification. On this classes we will focuse on a simple task of regression."
